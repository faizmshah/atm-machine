# atm-machine
The "atm-machine" project is a TypeScript/Node.js application designed as a console-based ATM simulator. Upon initiation, the user is prompted to input their user ID and PIN for authentication. The simulator then provides a command-line interface (CLI) through which users can access two primary functions: withdrawing funds and checking balance.

This CLI interface offers clear instructions and prompts, ensuring ease of use for the user. Whether they're withdrawing funds or checking their balance, the interface guides them through each step of the process, making it straightforward and user-friendly.

Developed in TypeScript and Node.js, this project demonstrates an understanding of backend development and CLI applications, providing a practical example of handling financial transactions in a simulated environment.
